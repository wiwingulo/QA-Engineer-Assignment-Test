How to setup the automation framework

- Install Katalon Studio 8.6.9 version
- Open Katalon.exe
- Import project Sauce Demo and Reqres API
- For sauce demo, choose test suite and run the project. After all tests have passed, check the report in the report folder generated by Katalon
- During execution, the Reqres API returns HTTP 403 when called from automation tools such as Katalon and Robot Framework due to Cloudflare bot protection.
The same request works correctly in Postman. This is a known limitation of public demo APIs and not related to the test implementation.
